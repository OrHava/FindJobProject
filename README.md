Welcome to FINDJOB, the Android app that helps connect job seekers with potential employers.

This app was built using Android Studio and Java, and utilizes Firebase for its realtime database and cloud storage needs. It also includes authentication for its three types of users: those looking for a job, those looking for workers, and admins.

Job seekers can use FINDJOB to search for available positions, create and submit a profile, and can send their Cv's for potential employers.

Employers can use FINDJOB to post job openings, see qualified candidates CV's.

Admins can manage user accounts, review and approve job postings, and oversee the overall operation of the app.

Thank you for using FIND JOB. We hope it helps you find your next career opportunity.
